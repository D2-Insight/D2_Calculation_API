Credit goes first and foremost as this would not have been possible without the great community of Destiny Massive Breakdowns and the people in it.
  * Mossy, a majority of damage values are from him and the underlying pve formulas for PL
  * RokDc(from redditðŸ˜©) for help with questions and more damage numbers
  * The destiny 2 compendium creators and maintainers for making my life easier
  * Kat the creater of d2foundry.gg for assisting me with JS bug testing and helping me coping with the language
